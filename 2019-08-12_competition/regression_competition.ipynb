    "# Energy price forecasting competition\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain the data to be used in the energy price forecasting competition \n",
    "2. Provide a template for importing the data and uploading results to the evaluation server\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy prices in two-day US energy markets are made up of two distinct components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A cost of energy, this is constant across all locations on the power grid within an hour, but varies hour by hour\n",
    "2. A location-specific variable cost\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-day structure of the market is such that participants bid each morning how much power they are willing to buy or sell at specific locations in each hour of the following day\n",
    "\n",
    "The power grid operator aggregates these individual bids and produces a market clearing price at each hour and location such that total supply and demand can be met\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on where an individual market participant's bid prices were relative to the market clearing price, they will either be awarded bids or not\n",
    "\n",
    "The next day when the bids are \"active\", unforseen circumstances often arise and the actual price of electricity at the specific locations will vary from the price announced by the power grid operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The price that was declared by the grid operator is referred to as the day ahead price and the price that prevails when bids are active in the next day is called the real time price\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to use fundamental data from the a US power grid to formulate 1-day ahead hourly forecasts for the day ahead and real time cost of energy (the component of prices that is constant across the entire power grid)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each day you will report a projected day-ahead marginal cost of energy (acronym `damce`) and a real time marginal cost of energy (acronym `rtmce`) for each of the 24 hours in the next day"
